- Notebooks are based on the lecture notes, I rewrote them in order to be able to test codes.
- Details as well as math rigour is omitted since the course focused on application of models using python.
- Course content:
    - Chapter 1: Python Quick Recap
    - Chapter 2: Python Arrays, Tables, Vectors, Matrices
    - Chapter 3: AI Short Description
    - Chapter 4: AI Regression 1 (linear regression, polynomial regression)
    - Chapter 5: AI Regression 2 (multiple linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression)
    - Chapter 6: AI Classification 1 (logistic regression, KNN)
    - Chapter 7: AI Classification 2 (SVM, Decision trees, text data)
